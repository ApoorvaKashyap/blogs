> Very naughty people use TOR.<br>

The above quote from the NSA documents revealed by Edward Snowden perhaps sums up the perception of the average internet user about The Onion Routing Project, commonly known as the TOR Project. This perception is not misplaced as TOR is often thrown in with nefarious websites like the Silk Road. However, that is only a misuse of an otherwise robust platform that is transforming the way we look at the internet today.
 
Back in the 90s, as the Internet began to expand, the lack of security on the Internet and its ability to be used for surveillance and monitoring became quite clear. To combat this, in 1995, David Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson at the US     Naval Research Lab (NRL) asked themselves if there was a way to create internet connections that do not reveal who is talking to whom, even to someone monitoring the network. Their answer was to create and deploy the first research designs and prototypes of ‘onion routing’. These prototypes were the predecessor to the project that would go on to define anonymity and privacy on the Internet.

This project was carried on by Roger Dingledine, and Nick Mathewson, the former christening the project ‘The Onion Routing (TOR), after the idea that the connection to a server using the TOR would go through various servers, called ‘hop points’, and the data would undergo encryption on each one, before finally connecting to the final server – layered, just like an onion. Initially only a proxy server, the TOR Project started the development of the TOR Browser in 2008, to make it more accessible to the average user, under the banner of the Tor Project Inc., a non-profit organization, initially funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Tor Project not only provides users anonymity while using the internet but also anonymity for hosting websites through its ‘onion’ services.

One of the basic principles underlying the development of the TOR was the Right to Privacy, a concept that sparked a global debate in 2013, with the Snowden revelations of 2013, to Glenn Greenwald and David Martini of The Guardian. These revelations forced the world to rethink the concept and sanctity of privacy, making them fall back to reports like Belmont’s, which subtly describes the need for privacy in the following words:

*“Maintaining privacy helps to protect people from potential harms including psychological harm such as embarrassment or distress; social harms such as loss of employment or damage to one’s financial standing, and criminal or civil liability.”*

Thus, in an era where the agencies and the companies are hell-bent on surveillance, projects like TOR take the burden to secure the right to privacy of individuals by providing them encrypted access to the Internet under the cloak of anonymity.

Today, the Tor Project has also evolved to advocate an uncensored internet, especially in countries that are not democracies, promoting this with the help of technologies like ‘bridge’, which hides any data being transferred by pretending that it is legal and legitimate. The project further promotes uncensored internet through its ‘onion’ hosting services, which masks the IP address of the website hosted as well as its owner, making it almost impossible to identify the person behind the computer.

Nevertheless, like all pieces of software, TOR has its drawbacks. Though impregnable in practice, it can be breached theoretically, using several infected nodes, which can reveal the data being transferred, as well as the user. However, that depends only on the misfortune of the users who happen to connect to that particular node in the TOR Network Relay. Thus, the TOR Network is practically impregnable, as highlighted in another NSA presentation titled ‘Tor Stinks.’ Further, it is also possible that these services are used for illegal purposes, which is further testimony to their security as the criminals will not use a service that has the slightest chance of exposing them.

Owing to the success of TOR and the need for privacy in the modern world, several specialized projects are being developed across the world, notable among them the Aqua project for anonymous file sharing, Herd for anonymous VoIP calls, Vuvuzela for anonymous chatting, among others. Other projects like the WhoNix OS are also coming up, based on the TOR Relay Network.

Thus, in a world based on the Internet, where data has become the most valuable currency, the necessity to protect the privacy of the common man becomes of paramount importance, resulting in the ever-increasing necessity of anonymity services like the TOR Project.
