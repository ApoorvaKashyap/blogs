The social and economic scenario of India is rendered incomplete without the mention of caste. The caste system, especially the caste identity, has become an important part of the Indian social identity.
However, it is a commonly held misconception that the caste system is an integral part of the Hindu society since the ancient times. However, this is not the case. For a very long time, the Hindu society was not hierarchical and functioned much like an egalitarian tribal society than a hierarchical one.

In this literature review, we shall critically examine the evolution of the caste system through various Hindu texts and their interpretations by some distinguished historians.

## Castes, Varna and Jatis

Before embarking on a discourse about the caste system, it is necessary to understand what exactly the caste system is, and how it is different from the Vedic Varna System.

The word caste is derived from the Portuguese word ‘casta’ meaning race or ancestry. The word casta itself has Latin roots in the word castus meaning pure.[^1] Hence the word itself is based on the principle of purity of human beings. However, this purity is more material in nature than spiritual. Hence, the basic characteristics of the caste are hereditary occupations, endogamous social divisions and the idea of untouchability that stems from the idea of purity and pollution.

The Varna System on the other hand, was more about the division of labour and was not hereditary. It followed a tribal structure of equal status among people and was not even hierarchical at the time of its conception. The Varna system comprises four Varnas: Brahmins(the academia), Kshatriyas(the Warriors), Vaishyas(the Merchants and Scribes) and Shudras(the Labourers). The people were classified on the basis of the jobs they performed.

The jaatis were the traces of ancestry and lineage and were based on birth. These jaatis were more of a personal identity than  a social identity. The conversion of jaatis from a personal identity to a socio-economic one was one of the major factors in the evolution of the caste system.

## Caste System in Ancient India

The first reference to the division in the Indian society comes in the tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda in two verses of the “Purusha Sukta”:

```
brāhmaṇo'sya mukhamāsīd bāhū rājanyaḥ kṛtaḥ,
ūrū tadasya yad vaiśyaḥ padbhyāgï śūdro ajāyata.
candramā manaso jātaḥcakśoḥ sūryo ajāyata,
mukhādindraścāgniśca prāṇādvāyurajāyata.
```

“The Brahmana (spiritual wisdom and splendour) was His mouth; the Kshatriya (administrative and military prowess) His arms became. His thighs were the Vaisya (commercial and business enterprise); of His feet the Sudra (productive and sustaining force) was born.”[^2]

According to several scholars like Max Mueller, this idea of the division was one of the chronologically latest additions to the Rig Veda. There is also a good consensus on the point that prior to this, there was no varna system in the society. The Bhagavad Purana and the Mahabharata mention that in Krita Yuga, there was no caste but only one varna of human beings - that of children of Vaivasvata Manu.[^3]

According to Dr BR Ambedkar, the Hindu society was previously divided into three varnas during the Vedic times and no varna of the Shudras. He is also of the opinion that the two verses in the Purusha Sukta are a later interpolation and that the Shudras were part of the Kshatriyas and hence a part of the Aryan Society itself. He was also opposed to the Aryan Invasion Theory[^4][^5] and did not agree that the Shudras and the untouchables were the defeated non-Aryans.For Ambedkar, many Shudras were part of the elite ruling class and some were even kings. They fell from grace when the Brahmins stopped performing the rite of ‘upnayan sanskar’ as a revenge against some insulting Shudra kings.

Ambedkar also believes that the practice of untouchability is a post-Buddhist phenomenon. He says that with the advent of new Hinduism by Adi Sankaracharya, beef-eating became a despised practise. Hence, those that continued to eat beef were excluded from  the society. Over the course of centuries, this exclusivism became the practise of untouchability. Even though some researchers don’t agree with Dr. Ambedkar on his point about the Shudras, there is wide consensus that the birth-based Varna System is a post-Vedic phenomenon and the practise of untouchability is a post-Buddhism one.

Even the sacred texts of Hindus like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, there is almost no discrimination between the king and the beggar and it was quite common to change Varna according to the occupation. For example, in the Mahabharata, the Yaksha asked Yudhisthira that how should the varna of people be decided, to which Yudhisthira replied that it should be done on the basis of their karma. Even Bhagavad Gita has several instances in which Krishna focuses on the importance of karma for the decision of the varna and not the birth.

The rishis of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana era often had obscure origins. Ved Vyas, the man who wrote Mahabharata and the Vedas was the son of a fisherwoman, yet he was respected more than the Brahmins. Similarly, Valmiki, the author of Ramayana is said to have been a robber before he turned into a rishi. Hence, it has been often depicted that the boundaries of the varnas were fluid.

The only support of birth based varna system can be found in the dharmashastras, the law codes. However, there is no unanimity among them on the basis of caste system.  In the Manusmriti, which is supposed to be a supporter of the caste system, the verse 176 of Chapter 4 states that:
“Discard wealth and desire if they are contrary to dharma, and even dharma itself , if it leads to unhappiness or arouses peoples’ indignation.”
Hence, if the varna dharma or the rules of conduct regarding varna or the caste system is leading to the unhappiness and indignation of people, then it should be abandoned.

Furthermore, the dharmashastras come under the ‘smritis’, which are given lower importance when they clash with the ‘shrutis’(Vedas and Puranas). However, the practise of caste system had taken place in India by 322 BCE - the establishment of the Maurya Empire. Megasthenes, a Greek explorer, has mentioned about seven types of varnas in his book ‘Indica’[^6]. Kautilya also mentions the various types of castes and how the king should deal with them. Thus, the Manusmriti, written in about 200 BCE, was just a way of formulating new laws for the governing of the evolving Hindu social life. The divisions mentioned by Megasthenes and Kautilya, are very similar to the varna system.They had just become more rigid.

Though many researchers believe the caste system to be an intrinsic part of the Hindu culture, M. Nandkarni takes a more utilitarian approach. He outlines five important causes of the development of the caste system[^7].
### I. System of Checks and Balances:
 The Vedic Varna System was a system to ensure decentralisation of power and efficient division of labour, allowing specialised professionals in the society. Thus, it was accepted wholeheartedly at its inception. A Bhramin was expected to gather knowledge and wisdom for the society, and preserve the Vedic traditions. Thus, he was dependent on the society for sustenance. The Kshatriya was supposed to provide security to the society and rule the society wisely. He had to listen to the counsel of his ministers and the grievances of the public. The Vaishya was tasked with bringing economic prosperity to the society through trade and commerce. The Shudra was to work in the fields and pastures and bring grains and other goods for the sustenance of the society. Hence the varna system was based on the division of labour and power.
### II. Easy Acquisition of Skills and Labour:
 Keeping the work within the family and teaching them to the sons and daughters was much easier than acquiring apprentices. This was further encouraged by the lack of skill schools in the ancient times. Further, this allowed the jaatis, especially the Vaishya and the Shudra to form guilds and organize themselves. Brahmins, on the other hand, were not able to organize themselves.
### III. Decentralised Democracy:
 The formation of guilds led to the formation of local regulatory bodies. This  allowed the society to settle disputes in an easy and inexpensive manner, thus further reducing the dependence on the kings. This is also the reason for discouragement of inter-caste marriages as such marriages would undermine the powers and authority of these panchayats, the basis of whose existence was the local caste settlements. This also led to the formation of huge lobby groups.
### IV. Ecological Role:
 Just like the Varna System, each caste had its own role to play in the village ecosystem. Some were labourers, some were artisans, some hunters etc. This division allowed the panchayats to regulate the natural ecological balance and avoid strain on the resources.
### V. Security of Livelihood and Employment:
 The primary objective of labour division was to produce sufficient for the local market. This meant that the customers and sellers had developed a cordial relationship. This meant that the buyer would shift to another customer if he provided more price and vice-versa, There was mutual trust among the communities.

These were the five key factors that led to the establishment of the caste system in the ancient Indian society.

## Caste System in the Medieval and Modern India

The caste system had been introduced and accepted by the Indian society by the end of the Ancient Period (about 900 AD). Thus, the introduction of Islam in India in 1206 AD, came as a boon for the lower castes, who were already being suppressed by then, specially sections of the Shudras and the untouchables. This provided them a way to break through the barriers of the caste system. Hence mass conversions took place. The caste system of the Hindus also influenced the Islamic practices and castes were also developed in the Indian Islamic practises[^8][^9].

The advent of Islam into India also brought the stimuli for the much needed introspection of the Hindu religion. Thus emerged the Bhakti movement in the early 12th century. The main focus of the Bhakti movement was on five major issues of Hinduism[^9][^10]:
God is one. (Monotheism)
Serving humanity is the better way to worship God.
All men are equal.
Self-devotion is better than rituals. Thus, everyone can pray to God, without the help of Brahmins.
Caste distinction and superstitious practises should be given up.
This movement was heavily inspired by the Islamic practises and was one of the major movements against the caste system. However, it was very uncoordinated and was taken forward by only poets and heretics. Despite all this the movement was a partial success and the dominance of Bhramins from the religious foreground was diminished.

Sanjay Chakreavorty feels that another major event with respect to the caste system of India took place in 1861 - India’s first census was taken. While the boundaries of the caste system were not rigid and caste was somewhere between a personal identity and a social one, the 1861 census cemented that line to simplify the Indian diaspora so that they could be easily documented. This cementing of lines was much similar to the Western feudal systems of Lords and Serfs. The Indians could now be categorized as Hindu or Muslims and their castes, with the upper castes becoming the Lords and the Barons while the lower castes had to survive as serfs[^11].

This resulting categorical system was made more rigid over the next century, especially through the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935, which introduced separate electorates and reservation of seats respectively.  Thus the nail of the caste system had been fully driven into the Indian Social Board.

## Conclusion

The caste system has never been an intrinsic part of the Indian society. It only grew and was accepted due to the advantages it offered. Now, it's no longer needed as there is no need for the local self-sustaining communities with hereditary jobs. With the ever growing reach of the Internet, the options are abundant. Hence the nail that has been driven needs to be taken out and let the society heal.
