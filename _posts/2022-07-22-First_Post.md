## You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. __Don't call me the Rotmeister.__ *Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.* Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

1. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
2. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
3. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

### I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

* I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
* You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
* Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hit me with a cricket bat. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

You've swallowed a planet! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket bat.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Saving the world with meals on wheels. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
