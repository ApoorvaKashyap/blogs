Over the course of next two weeks, I wish to impose upon the readers of this blog, an academic document of perhaps unwieldy importance to the readers but was sacrosanct in completion of my graduate degree. It was thus, on the completion of this academic document of utmost importance that I was finally awarded my degree in the due course of time. This document was, as per the manners of naming everything in NRTI, called **the Graduation Thesis Project** or **GTP** for short and carried two trimesters worth of credits. <br/>

It was thus, with the same excitement that befalls a boy when he has a learned a new trick, that the whole batch of 2019-22 plunged into the creation of this esteemed work of academia, which shall, for the remainder of duration of their stay at NRTI would be a mark of their excellence. And accustomed as everyone is at this young ripe age, to the inherent mechanisms of herd behaviour, I followed along *(though I still believe it was inevitable task that would have demanded my attention sooner or later)* and found a mate of similar interests in Mr Anshuman Bajpai. <br/>

And hence we set off on a journey long enough to let us know each other well but yet short enough that we almost overshot the time limit prescribed by the Institute. Out of this conundrum was born our final GTP, on the topic ***"2-Wheeler Electric Vehicles Purchase Intention: A Study of Indian College Students"***. <br/>

I do not intend to bore my readers further and rather let them decide the quality of our work featured in the upcoming blog posts.
