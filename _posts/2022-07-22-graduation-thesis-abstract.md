The crescent global concern about climate change caused by automotive greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the environmental destruction of natural resources, is pushing world economies to adopt a innovative alternative fuel technology. Electric vehicles are being posed as a green and sustainable innovative technology which has the potential to empower a streamlined transition to a low-carbon transportation system while preserving natural resources. Numerous nations have put forth extraordinary attempts to help the utilisation of electric vehicles as of late; for instance, Modern nations together with Norway and the Netherlands in Europe and the United States have strengthened individuals’ desire to utilise electric vehicles through suitable appropriations and concealment of private vehicles. In Asia, Taiwan has been fostering the arrangement of supplanting fossil fuel based traditional two-wheeler vehicles with two-wheeler electric vehicles (TWEVs) and reinforcing the approach through supplanting countless old TWEVs and sponsoring the acquisition of TWEVs. This study was conducted on college going students, as they were the main likely category to purchase TWEVs, and their idea of natural manageability can be moulded for developing vehicle use propensities. This study uses a survey form to investigate the factors influencing the purchase of traditional two-wheeler and factors that will prompt a college going student to purchase a two-wheeler electric vehicle in near future. Factor analysis is conducted on the Likert scale data obtained through questionnaire survey to club the lots of variables into a few factors for easier interpretation. This study used IBM SPSS software to carry out factor analysis. Later on, A comparative assessment has been done of the factors affecting purchase intention of fossil fuel based traditional two-wheeler and two-wheeler electric vehicles.
