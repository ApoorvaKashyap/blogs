Belonging to a Scheduled Caste, he had a childhood filled with hardships. Taught to bow down in front of the ‘bade log’, and serve them without questions and expectations, he had often seen his father and mother being abused and exploited, eating the leftovers and having no respect whatsoever in the hierarchical society of his village. It had been a long journey, from those backwaters of Southern Bihar to the comfortable AC workspace he was sitting in right now - a journey full of harsh struggles but yet bound by the hope of pulling himself out of the vicious cycle of hierarchy that had plagued the Indian society for over two millennia.</p><p>Such examples like Ramesh’s are quite commonplace in today’s Indian backdrop, notable among them being Omprakash Valmiki’s Joothan, which talks about his plight as a Dalit child. However, such examples would not have existed without the concept of “Affirmative Actions” based on the idea of “Positive Discrimination”. The Oxford Dictionary defines “Affirmative Actions” as ​the practice or policy of making sure that a particular number of jobs, etc. are given to people from groups that are often treated unfairly because of their race, sex, etc. Affirmative Actions were needed since time immemorial, but they were not there from a very long time. They have been more of a modern measure to uplift the status of socially and historically oppressed classes</p><h2 id="why-and-how-it-all-started"><span class="mr-2">Why and How it all started?</span><a href="#why-and-how-it-all-started" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The history of the need for affirmative actions goes beyond their inception. The concept of Affirmative Action in India dates back to the times when the social strata of India were churning up. Times when reforms were being made, times when the oppressed castes began to realise that they are not born to serve the so-called ‘bade log’. It dates back to the times when Dalits started searching for the meaning of the word Dalit itself.</p><p><strong>1902</strong>. Something strange - at least for the society of India in the 20th century - happened in Kolhapur. Shahu, the monarch of Kolhapur introduced the concept of “affirmative action” in India for the first time. He reserved seats for socially backward communities in schools and ensured that they get employed suitably after studying. He did tiring efforts to uplift the status of weaker sections of the society. He even encouraged the reading of Vedas and other religious texts by non-brahmins thus demolishing the entitlement to religion which brahmins thought was their birthright.</p><p>Next development in the history of Affirmative Actions in India came only in 1933 when British Government introduced the communal award which granted separate electorates for Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Depressed Classes. But Gandhi objected against it and went on a fast. After much discussion between Dr Ambedkar and Gandhi, Poona Pact of 1932 was worked out, which said that there will be Hindu electorates with certain reservations in them. Poona Pact laid down the foundations of the current system of caste-based reservations in India. It established the notion that the sections of Indian society which have been oppressed historically and socially can now come into the mainstream. They can have their own identity and can walk shoulder-to-shoulder with the comparatively stronger sections.</p><p>What happened in 1932 traced its way into the Constitution of India. India got independence in 1947 and with it came the need of a constitution. Dr B.R. Ambedkar was made the head of Drafting committee of the Constitution, and after endless debates over the issue of reservations, it was decided that the reservation will be provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in independent India. The same was adopted in 1950 and hence started the practice of Affirmative Actions in independent India, and hence started the controversies.</p><p>Next development came as late as in 1990 when the Mandal Commission in its report advised for 27% reservations for the Backward classes. And the latest can be traced just a year back in 2019 when the current BJP government brought into effect the EWS reservation for the economically-weaker sections of castes not included in the scheduled categories.</p><h2 id="how-is-it-affecting-us-today"><span class="mr-2">How is it Affecting us Today?</span><a href="#how-is-it-affecting-us-today" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The concept of Affirmative Actions in India has always been controversial since its inception. From Gandhi suggesting it as an all-encompassing alternative as opposed to separate electorates to the Indira Sawhney case of 1992, the reservation has been through many developments.</p><p>In 1951, in the State of Madras v. Srimathi Champakam Dorairajan and Venkataraman v. State of Madras case, the Supreme Court of India held that reservation of any sort based on caste is purely unconstitutional. But it was then reversed by the Nehru government by the first amendment in Indian Constitution which made the law invalid by amending the Article 15 saying that “Nothing in this article or Clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.”. And this became the first constitutional amendment in independent India.</p><p>Later in 1992, in a landmark judgement in the Indira Sawhney case, Supreme amended the reservation system prevailed in India till then. It excluded the creamy layer of OBC categories enjoying the provisions of reservation. It also held set the maximum limit of the reservation to be 50%. In the same judgement, the court held that that the reservations can not be applied to promotions.</p><p>So it has been a consistent and complex struggle for the lower strata of the society to achieve what they deserve. Though it has been successful in ameliorating the sitch of the socially backward sections of the society, at the same time it has put before us many questions? Is the reservation necessary in today’s scenario or we need something else? Has reservation been able to achieve its true goals for which it was put into the constitution in the first place?</p><p>There are no correct answers to the above questions. When we take into consideration the wonders the concept of reservation was made in alleviating the backward sections of Indian society, we should also keep in mind the foul it has done.</p><p>Assume the case of Raghav Gupta, a friend of Ramesh Das’s son, ( Ramesh Das is the same person whose story you read in the introduction). They both used to study together. They were friends. Raghav used to make sure that his friend does not lag in studies. But when they sat down to write the same examination, Raghav did not get selected, but his friend did. He did not only get selected but was even helmed being from a backward community and yet clearing the exam with flying colours. One could never have guessed the other side of the story which you were reading.</p><p>Cases like Raghav’s are as common as Ramesh’s in Indian society today. Lives are being destroyed due to the fear and the pressure of people who enjoy reservation. When you study the same as the person who is sitting beside you, but somehow belongs to the scheduled categories, you both may score the same in the examination, but he gets selected and you do not. This would certainly let you down, make you question the system and this is precisely what brings us to our next question - Are affirmative actions ethical?</p><h2 id="are-affirmative-actions-ethical"><span class="mr-2">Are Affirmative Actions Ethical?</span><a href="#are-affirmative-actions-ethical" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>When we begin to talk about the ethicality of Affirmative Actions, we need to keep a few things in mind: the years of contempt faced by the downtrodden communities, the idea of the welfare state and the impact of affirmative action on the social as well as economic structures of the society it is being implemented in. We also need to keep in mind its major objective and need to critically analyse its efficiency.</p><p>Let’s begin with the concept of the welfare state. The concept of the welfare state is essentially a concept of government in which the state or a well-established network of social institutions plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. Thus it becomes the onus of the government to take care of the downtrodden communities and provide them with equal playing ground, at least in terms of education.</p><p>Thus, the concept of affirmative actions came to the forefront, to promote equality and reduce the social seclusion of these communities. The idea of the affirmative actions can also be seen as a compensation of the years of wrong, as has been propounded across the globe in forms like the “stolen generation” in Australia and the injustice to Blacks during Apartheid in South Africa, thus creating betterment for backward communities using positive discrimination. This approach is meant to be in its essence quite utilitarian in nature, trying to bring maximum pleasure to the maximum number of people. But is it so? Is it fulfilling its purpose?</p><p>There has been a striking increase in the number of SC and ST government employees. The absolute number of SC employees increased from 218,000 in 1950 to 641,000 in 1991, although it fell to 540,000 in 2003 following a contraction of total government employment. The percentage of SC employees in total government employment increased from 12% in 1956 to about 16% in 2003, fairly close to their share in the population. The absolute number of ST employees increased from 38,0000 in 1960 to 211,000 in 2003, which represented an increase from 2% to 6% of total government employment.</p><p>The evidence also indicates that there has been a striking increase in the number of SC and ST government employees. The absolute number of SC employees increased from 218,000 in 1950 to 641,000 in 1991, although it fell to 540,000 in 2003 following a contraction of total government employment. The percentage of SC employees in total government employment increased from 12% in 1956 to about 16% in 2003, fairly close to their share in the population. The absolute number of ST employees increased from 38,0000 in 1960 to 211,000 in 2003, which represented an increase from 2% to 6% of total government employment.</p><p>Further, there has in recent years been a clear improvement in human development indicators among SCs and STs. Between 1983/84 and 1999/2000, for example, monthly per capita consumption expenditure and literacy rates among SCs and STs both increased, while the incidence of poverty fell. Nevertheless, the size of the improvement has generally been lower among SCs and STs than among other groups, so that SCs and STs continue to lag behind other segments of the Indian population. The above evidence clearly shows that there has indeed been a rise in the living standards of the depressed communities, though only partial. Thus in this respect, the system of affirmative action seems to fulfil its purpose and hence alright prima facie.</p><p>But on closer observation, we find several basic questions: is it alright to reserve some opportunities of the public domain for a specific community? Shouldn’t merit be valued over societal structure? Do the communities need to be reminded again and again about their exploitative history? Does this not undermine the unity of the country by creating a divide between the communities?</p><p>The answer to the first question lies in the basic idea of affirmative actions itself. The upliftment of the communities in its entirety is based on the idea of economic independence of these communities from the higher castes. The idea of economic strata becomes important in this aspect, especially in the Indian context as it proves to be the difference in the treatment of Adivasis and the immigrant Parsis and Muslims in the medieval era. Thus in this context, it becomes essential to provide them with the jobs to become independent. The Indian society, laden with the caste system was reluctant to provide them with jobs and thus it became quintessential for the government to reserve a portion of its jobs for these communities, to uplift them.</p><p>A similar argument goes for the concept of merit. The idea of merit itself is dependent on economic factors. Let’s go back to the two cases of Raghav and Ramesh. The fact that Raghav belongs to an upper caste family means that he can afford much more refined education than Ramesh, the latter, even if he is brilliant can’t afford to go to coachings and hence is not at par with Raghav in terms of training and education and hence is at a disadvantage. Thus it becomes necessary for entities like Ramesh to enjoy some relaxation in the marks criteria, to compensate for the lag.</p><p>The answer to the third question lies in the fact that as humans we always try to cover up the facts that highlight our mistakes. This question represents a form of moral policing for the depressed classes, insisting that what happened was history and should be forgotten. The line of thought is similar to the fourth question as well. However, one must remember that instead of covering up our mistakes, we should accept them and then move forward, while trying to rectify them at the same time. These actions are, in essence, only a minor rectification of two millennia of exploitation. Lastly, a country only remains unified until the communities residing in it are happy and prosperous and feel their importance in the country. Thus, these actions also take care of such aspects.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><span class="mr-2">Conclusion</span><a href="#conclusion" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The ethicality of affirmative actions depends on a variety of factors, foremost amongst them being the contempt faced by the communities spanning millennia. There are questions but they dull in comparison to the mammoth task of social inclusion these actions serve. But, in spite of all that, one question still shines out like a star: What if these communities begin to misuse the system, using it to undermine the opportunities of others, even after becoming prosperous? This question has indeed been thought out well and hence a provision of a ten-year limit on implementation of the reservation system in India. A better solution, however, would be to implement economic status based reservation instead of caste-based. This would ensure that the advantage would reach only those people who need it. Further, it is also important to note that in the sprawling metros of today, people of both upper and lower castes face the impact of poverty alike. Thus, it would resolve this problem too. However, this can only be implemented when the discrimination based on caste is almost non-existent in the Indian backdrop, so that caste is no longer a barrier in the public sphere. Till then, we can only hope to move forward with the caste-based affirmative actions system.</p><hr /><h4 id="credits"><span class="mr-2">Credits</span><a href="#credits" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@crtvben?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ben Richardson</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/poverty?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/blogs/categories/nrti/'>NRTI</a>, <a href='/blogs/categories/blogs/'>Blogs</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/blogs/tags/ethics/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >ethics</a> <a href="/blogs/tags/affirmative-actions/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >affirmative actions</a> <a href="/blogs/tags/nrti/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >nrti</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ethics+of+Affirmative+Actions+-+Random+Thoughts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapoorvakashyap.github.io%2Fblogs%2Fposts%2Fethics-of-affirmative-actions%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Ethics+of+Affirmative+Actions+-+Random+Thoughts&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapoorvakashyap.github.io%2Fblogs%2Fposts%2Fethics-of-affirmative-actions%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapoorvakashyap.github.io%2Fblogs%2Fposts%2Fethics-of-affirmative-actions%2F&text=Ethics+of+Affirmative+Actions+-+Random+Thoughts" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/blogs/posts/graduation-thesis-introduction-thesis/">Graduation Thesis | Introduction to Thesis</a><li><a href="/blogs/posts/ethics-of-affirmative-actions/">Ethics of Affirmative Actions</a><li><a href="/blogs/posts/caste-in-indian-history-an-overview/">Caste in Indian History -
