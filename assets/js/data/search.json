This perception is not misplaced as TOR is often thrown in with nefarious websites like the Silk Road. However, that is only a misuse of an otherwise robust platform that is transforming the way we look at the internet today.Back in the 90s, as the Internet began to expand, the lack of security on the Internet and its ability to be used for surveillance and monitoring became quite clear. To combat this, in 1995, David Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson at the US Naval Research Lab (NRL) asked themselves if there was a way to create internet connections that do not reveal who is talking to whom, even to someone monitoring the network. Their answer was to create and deploy the first research designs and prototypes of ‘onion routing’. These prototypes were the predecessor to the project that would go on to define anonymity and privacy on the Internet.This project was carried on by Roger Dingledine, and Nick Mathewson, the former christening the project ‘The Onion Routing (TOR), after the idea that the connection to a server using the TOR would go through various servers, called ‘hop points’, and the data would undergo encryption on each one, before finally connecting to the final server – layered, just like an onion. Initially only a proxy server, the TOR Project started the development of the TOR Browser in 2008, to make it more accessible to the average user, under the banner of the Tor Project Inc., a non-profit organization, initially funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Tor Project not only provides users anonymity while using the internet but also anonymity for hosting websites through its ‘onion’ services.One of the basic principles underlying the development of the TOR was the Right to Privacy, a concept that sparked a global debate in 2013, with the Snowden revelations of 2013, to Glenn Greenwald and David Martini of The Guardian. These revelations forced the world to rethink the concept and sanctity of privacy, making them fall back to reports like Belmont’s, which subtly describes the need for privacy in the following words:“Maintaining privacy helps to protect people from potential harms including psychological harm such as embarrassment or distress; social harms such as loss of employment or damage to one’s financial standing, and criminal or civil liability.”Thus, in an era where the agencies and the companies are hell-bent on surveillance, projects like TOR take the burden to secure the right to privacy of individuals by providing them encrypted access to the Internet under the cloak of anonymity.Today, the Tor Project has also evolved to advocate an uncensored internet, especially in countries that are not democracies, promoting this with the help of technologies like ‘bridge’, which hides any data being transferred by pretending that it is legal and legitimate. The project further promotes uncensored internet through its ‘onion’ hosting services, which masks the IP address of the website hosted as well as its owner, making it almost impossible to identify the person behind the computer.Nevertheless, like all pieces of software, TOR has its drawbacks. Though impregnable in practice, it can be breached theoretically, using several infected nodes, which can reveal the data being transferred, as well as the user. However, that depends only on the misfortune of the users who happen to connect to that particular node in the TOR Network Relay. Thus, the TOR Network is practically impregnable, as highlighted in another NSA presentation titled ‘Tor Stinks.’ Further, it is also possible that these services are used for illegal purposes, which is further testimony to their security as the criminals will not use a service that has the slightest chance of exposing them.Owing to the success of TOR and the need for privacy in the modern world, several specialized projects are being developed across the world, notable among them the Aqua project for anonymous file sharing, Herd for anonymous VoIP calls, Vuvuzela for anonymous chatting, among others. Other projects like the WhoNix OS are also coming up, based on the TOR Relay Network.Thus, in a world based on the Internet, where data has become the most valuable currency, the necessity to protect the privacy of the common man becomes of paramount importance, resulting in the ever-increasing necessity of anonymity services like the TOR Project." }, { "title": "Caste in Indian History - An Overview", "url": "/blogs/posts/caste-in-indian-history-an-overview/", "categories": "NRTI, Blogs", "tags": "nrti, caste, society, thoughts", "date": "2022-08-05 01:10:00 +0530", "snippet": "The social and economic scenario of India is rendered incomplete without the mention of caste. The caste system, especially the caste identity, has become an important part of the Indian social identity.However, it is a commonly held misconception that the caste system is an integral part of the Hindu society since the ancient times. However, this is not the case. For a very long time, the Hindu society was not hierarchical and functioned much like an egalitarian tribal society than a hierarchical one.In this literature review, we shall critically examine the evolution of the caste system through various Hindu texts and their interpretations by some distinguished historians.Castes, Varna and JatisBefore embarking on a discourse about the caste system, it is necessary to understand what exactly the caste system is, and how it is different from the Vedic Varna System.The word caste is derived from the Portuguese word ‘casta’ meaning race or ancestry. The word casta itself has Latin roots in the word castus meaning pure.1 Hence the word itself is based on the principle of purity of human beings. However, this purity is more material in nature than spiritual. Hence, the basic characteristics of the caste are hereditary occupations, endogamous social divisions and the idea of untouchability that stems from the idea of purity and pollution.The Varna System on the other hand, was more about the division of labour and was not hereditary. It followed a tribal structure of equal status among people and was not even hierarchical at the time of its conception. The Varna system comprises four Varnas: Brahmins(the academia), Kshatriyas(the Warriors), Vaishyas(the Merchants and Scribes) and Shudras(the Labourers). The people were classified on the basis of the jobs they performed.The jaatis were the traces of ancestry and lineage and were based on birth. These jaatis were more of a personal identity than a social identity. The conversion of jaatis from a personal identity to a socio-economic one was one of the major factors in the evolution of the caste system.Caste System in Ancient IndiaThe first reference to the division in the Indian society comes in the tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda in two verses of the “Purusha Sukta”:brāhmaṇo'sya mukhamāsīd bāhū rājanyaḥ kṛtaḥ,ūrū tadasya yad vaiśyaḥ padbhyāgï śūdro ajāyata.candramā manaso jātaḥcakśoḥ sūryo ajāyata,mukhādindraścāgniśca prāṇādvāyurajāyata.“The Brahmana (spiritual wisdom and splendour) was His mouth; the Kshatriya (administrative and military prowess) His arms became. His thighs were the Vaisya (commercial and business enterprise); of His feet the Sudra (productive and sustaining force) was born.”2According to several scholars like Max Mueller, this idea of the division was one of the chronologically latest additions to the Rig Veda. There is also a good consensus on the point that prior to this, there was no varna system in the society. The Bhagavad Purana and the Mahabharata mention that in Krita Yuga, there was no caste but only one varna of human beings - that of children of Vaivasvata Manu.3According to Dr BR Ambedkar, the Hindu society was previously divided into three varnas during the Vedic times and no varna of the Shudras. He is also of the opinion that the two verses in the Purusha Sukta are a later interpolation and that the Shudras were part of the Kshatriyas and hence a part of the Aryan Society itself. He was also opposed to the Aryan Invasion Theory45 and did not agree that the Shudras and the untouchables were the defeated non-Aryans.For Ambedkar, many Shudras were part of the elite ruling class and some were even kings. They fell from grace when the Brahmins stopped performing the rite of ‘upnayan sanskar’ as a revenge against some insulting Shudra kings.Ambedkar also believes that the practice of untouchability is a post-Buddhist phenomenon. He says that with the advent of new Hinduism by Adi Sankaracharya, beef-eating became a despised practise. Hence, those that continued to eat beef were excluded from the society. Over the course of centuries, this exclusivism became the practise of untouchability. Even though some researchers don’t agree with Dr. Ambedkar on his point about the Shudras, there is wide consensus that the birth-based Varna System is a post-Vedic phenomenon and the practise of untouchability is a post-Buddhism one.Even the sacred texts of Hindus like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, there is almost no discrimination between the king and the beggar and it was quite common to change Varna according to the occupation. For example, in the Mahabharata, the Yaksha asked Yudhisthira that how should the varna of people be decided, to which Yudhisthira replied that it should be done on the basis of their karma. Even Bhagavad Gita has several instances in which Krishna focuses on the importance of karma for the decision of the varna and not the birth.The rishis of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana era often had obscure origins. Ved Vyas, the man who wrote Mahabharata and the Vedas was the son of a fisherwoman, yet he was respected more than the Brahmins. Similarly, Valmiki, the author of Ramayana is said to have been a robber before he turned into a rishi. Hence, it has been often depicted that the boundaries of the varnas were fluid.The only support of birth based varna system can be found in the dharmashastras, the law codes. However, there is no unanimity among them on the basis of caste system. In the Manusmriti, which is supposed to be a supporter of the caste system, the verse 176 of Chapter 4 states that:“Discard wealth and desire if they are contrary to dharma, and even dharma itself , if it leads to unhappiness or arouses peoples’ indignation.”Hence, if the varna dharma or the rules of conduct regarding varna or the caste system is leading to the unhappiness and indignation of people, then it should be abandoned.Furthermore, the dharmashastras come under the ‘smritis’, which are given lower importance when they clash with the ‘shrutis’(Vedas and Puranas). However, the practise of caste system had taken place in India by 322 BCE - the establishment of the Maurya Empire. Megasthenes, a Greek explorer, has mentioned about seven types of varnas in his book ‘Indica’6. Kautilya also mentions the various types of castes and how the king should deal with them. Thus, the Manusmriti, written in about 200 BCE, was just a way of formulating new laws for the governing of the evolving Hindu social life. The divisions mentioned by Megasthenes and Kautilya, are very similar to the varna system.They had just become more rigid.Though many researchers believe the caste system to be an intrinsic part of the Hindu culture, M. Nandkarni takes a more utilitarian approach. He outlines five important causes of the development of the caste system7.I. System of Checks and BalancesThe Vedic Varna System was a system to ensure decentralisation of power and efficient division of labour, allowing specialised professionals in the society. Thus, it was accepted wholeheartedly at its inception. A Bhramin was expected to gather knowledge and wisdom for the society, and preserve the Vedic traditions. Thus, he was dependent on the society for sustenance. The Kshatriya was supposed to provide security to the society and rule the society wisely. He had to listen to the counsel of his ministers and the grievances of the public. The Vaishya was tasked with bringing economic prosperity to the society through trade and commerce. The Shudra was to work in the fields and pastures and bring grains and other goods for the sustenance of the society. Hence the varna system was based on the division of labour and power.II. Easy Acquisition of Skills and LabourKeeping the work within the family and teaching them to the sons and daughters was much easier than acquiring apprentices. This was further encouraged by the lack of skill schools in the ancient times. Further, this allowed the jaatis, especially the Vaishya and the Shudra to form guilds and organize themselves. Brahmins, on the other hand, were not able to organize themselves.III. Decentralised DemocracyThe formation of guilds led to the formation of local regulatory bodies. This allowed the society to settle disputes in an easy and inexpensive manner, thus further reducing the dependence on the kings. This is also the reason for discouragement of inter-caste marriages as such marriages would undermine the powers and authority of these panchayats, the basis of whose existence was the local caste settlements. This also led to the formation of huge lobby groups.IV. Ecological RoleJust like the Varna System, each caste had its own role to play in the village ecosystem. Some were labourers, some were artisans, some hunters etc. This division allowed the panchayats to regulate the natural ecological balance and avoid strain on the resources.V. Security of Livelihood and EmploymentThe primary objective of labour division was to produce sufficient for the local market. This meant that the customers and sellers had developed a cordial relationship. This meant that the buyer would shift to another customer if he provided more price and vice-versa, There was mutual trust among the communities.These were the five key factors that led to the establishment of the caste system in the ancient Indian society.Caste System in the Medieval and Modern IndiaThe caste system had been introduced and accepted by the Indian society by the end of the Ancient Period (about 900 AD). Thus, the introduction of Islam in India in 1206 AD, came as a boon for the lower castes, who were already being suppressed by then, specially sections of the Shudras and the untouchables. This provided them a way to break through the barriers of the caste system. Hence mass conversions took place. The caste system of the Hindus also influenced the Islamic practices and castes were also developed in the Indian Islamic practises89.The advent of Islam into India also brought the stimuli for the much needed introspection of the Hindu religion. Thus emerged the Bhakti movement in the early 12th century. The main focus of the Bhakti movement was on five major issues of Hinduism910:God is one. (Monotheism)Serving humanity is the better way to worship God.All men are equal.Self-devotion is better than rituals. Thus, everyone can pray to God, without the help of Brahmins.Caste distinction and superstitious practises should be given up.This movement was heavily inspired by the Islamic practises and was one of the major movements against the caste system. However, it was very uncoordinated and was taken forward by only poets and heretics. Despite all this the movement was a partial success and the dominance of Bhramins from the religious foreground was diminished.Sanjay Chakreavorty feels that another major event with respect to the caste system of India took place in 1861 - India’s first census was taken. While the boundaries of the caste system were not rigid and caste was somewhere between a personal identity and a social one, the 1861 census cemented that line to simplify the Indian diaspora so that they could be easily documented. This cementing of lines was much similar to the Western feudal systems of Lords and Serfs. The Indians could now be categorized as Hindu or Muslims and their castes, with the upper castes becoming the Lords and the Barons while the lower castes had to survive as serfs11.This resulting categorical system was made more rigid over the next century, especially through the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935, which introduced separate electorates and reservation of seats respectively. Thus the nail of the caste system had been fully driven into the Indian Social Board.ConclusionThe caste system has never been an intrinsic part of the Indian society. It only grew and was accepted due to the advantages it offered. Now, it’s no longer needed as there is no need for the local self-sustaining communities with hereditary jobs. With the ever growing reach of the Internet, the options are abundant. Hence the nail that has been driven needs to be taken out and let the society heal.CreditsCover Photo by British Library on UnsplashReferences Collinsdictionary.com. n.d.

Belonging to a Scheduled Caste, he had a childhood filled with hardships. Taught to bow down in front of the ‘bade log’, and serve them without questions and expectations, he had often seen his father and mother being abused and exploited, eating the leftovers and having no respect whatsoever in the hierarchical society of his village. It had been a long journey, from those backwaters of Southern Bihar to the comfortable AC workspace he was sitting in right now - a journey full of harsh struggles but yet bound by the hope of pulling himself out of the vicious cycle of hierarchy that had plagued the Indian society for over two millennia.Such examples like Ramesh’s are quite commonplace in today’s Indian backdrop, notable among them being Omprakash Valmiki’s Joothan, which talks about his plight as a Dalit child. However, such examples would not have existed without the concept of “Affirmative Actions” based on the idea of “Positive Discrimination”.The Oxford Dictionary defines “Affirmative Actions” as ​the practice or policy of making sure that a particular number of jobs, etc. are given to people from groups that are often treated unfairly because of their race, sex, etc.Affirmative Actions were needed since time immemorial, but they were not there from a very long time. They have been more of a modern measure to uplift the status of socially and historically oppressed classesWhy and How it all started?The history of the need for affirmative actions goes beyond their inception. The concept of Affirmative Action in India dates back to the times when the social strata of India were churning up. Times when reforms were being made, times when the oppressed castes began to realise that they are not born to serve the so-called ‘bade log’. It dates back to the times when Dalits started searching for the meaning of the word Dalit itself.1902. Something strange - at least for the society of India in the 20th century - happened in Kolhapur. Shahu, the monarch of Kolhapur introduced the concept of “affirmative action” in India for the first time. He reserved seats for socially backward communities in schools and ensured that they get employed suitably after studying. He did tiring efforts to uplift the status of weaker sections of the society. He even encouraged the reading of Vedas and other religious texts by non-brahmins thus demolishing the entitlement to religion which brahmins thought was their birthright.Next development in the history of Affirmative Actions in India came only in 1933 when British Government introduced the communal award which granted separate electorates for Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Depressed Classes. But Gandhi objected against it and went on a fast. After much discussion between Dr Ambedkar and Gandhi, Poona Pact of 1932 was worked out, which said that there will be Hindu electorates with certain reservations in them.Poona Pact laid down the foundations of the current system of caste-based reservations in India. It established the notion that the sections of Indian society which have been oppressed historically and socially can now come into the mainstream. They can have their own identity and can walk shoulder-to-shoulder with the comparatively stronger sections.What happened in 1932 traced its way into the Constitution of India. India got independence in 1947 and with it came the need of a constitution. Dr B.R. Ambedkar was made the head of Drafting committee of the Constitution, and after endless debates over the issue of reservations, it was decided that the reservation will be provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in independent India. The same was adopted in 1950 and hence started the practice of Affirmative Actions in independent India, and hence started the controversies.Next development came as late as in 1990 when the Mandal Commission in its report advised for 27% reservations for the Backward classes.And the latest can be traced just a year back in 2019 when the current BJP government brought into effect the EWS reservation for the economically-weaker sections of castes not included in the scheduled categories.How is it Affecting us Today?The concept of Affirmative Actions in India has always been controversial since its inception. From Gandhi suggesting it as an all-encompassing alternative as opposed to separate electorates to the Indira Sawhney case of 1992, the reservation has been through many developments.In 1951, in the State of Madras v. Srimathi Champakam Dorairajan and Venkataraman v. State of Madras case, the Supreme Court of India held that reservation of any sort based on caste is purely unconstitutional. But it was then reversed by the Nehru government by the first amendment in Indian Constitution which made the law invalid by amending the Article 15 saying that “Nothing in this article or Clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.”. And this became the first constitutional amendment in independent India.Later in 1992, in a landmark judgement in the Indira Sawhney case, Supreme amended the reservation system prevailed in India till then. It excluded the creamy layer of OBC categories enjoying the provisions of reservation. It also held set the maximum limit of the reservation to be 50%. In the same judgement, the court held that that the reservations can not be applied to promotions.So it has been a consistent and complex struggle for the lower strata of the society to achieve what they deserve. Though it has been successful in ameliorating the sitch of the socially backward sections of the society, at the same time it has put before us many questions?Is the reservation necessary in today’s scenario or we need something else? Has reservation been able to achieve its true goals for which it was put into the constitution in the first place?There are no correct answers to the above questions. When we take into consideration the wonders the concept of reservation was made in alleviating the backward sections of Indian society, we should also keep in mind the foul it has done.Assume the case of Raghav Gupta, a friend of Ramesh Das’s son, ( Ramesh Das is the same person whose story you read in the introduction). They both used to study together. They were friends. Raghav used to make sure that his friend does not lag in studies. But when they sat down to write the same examination, Raghav did not get selected, but his friend did. He did not only get selected but was even helmed being from a backward community and yet clearing the exam with flying colours. One could never have guessed the other side of the story which you were reading.Cases like Raghav’s are as common as Ramesh’s in Indian society today. Lives are being destroyed due to the fear and the pressure of people who enjoy reservation. When you study the same as the person who is sitting beside you, but somehow belongs to the scheduled categories, you both may score the same in the examination, but he gets selected and you do not. This would certainly let you down, make you question the system and this is precisely what brings us to our next question - Are affirmative actions ethical?Are Affirmative Actions Ethical?When we begin to talk about the ethicality of Affirmative Actions, we need to keep a few things in mind: the years of contempt faced by the downtrodden communities, the idea of the welfare state and the impact of affirmative action on the social as well as economic structures of the society it is being implemented in. We also need to keep in mind its major objective and need to critically analyse its efficiency.Let’s begin with the concept of the welfare state. The concept of the welfare state is essentially a concept of government in which the state or a well-established network of social institutions plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of citizens. It is based on the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. Thus it becomes the onus of the government to take care of the downtrodden communities and provide them with equal playing ground, at least in terms of education.Thus, the concept of affirmative actions came to the forefront, to promote equality and reduce the social seclusion of these communities. The idea of the affirmative actions can also be seen as a compensation of the years of wrong, as has been propounded across the globe in forms like the “stolen generation” in Australia and the injustice to Blacks during Apartheid in South Africa, thus creating betterment for backward communities using positive discrimination.This approach is meant to be in its essence quite utilitarian in nature, trying to bring maximum pleasure to the maximum number of people. But is it so? Is it fulfilling its purpose?There has been a striking increase in the number of SC and ST government employees. The absolute number of SC employees increased from 218,000 in 1950 to 641,000 in 1991, although it fell to 540,000 in 2003 following a contraction of total government employment. The percentage of SC employees in total government employment increased from 12% in 1956 to about 16% in 2003, fairly close to their share in the population. The absolute number of ST employees increased from 38,0000 in 1960 to 211,000 in 2003, which represented an increase from 2% to 6% of total government employment.The evidence also indicates that there has been a striking increase in the number of SC and ST government employees. The absolute number of SC employees increased from 218,000 in 1950 to 641,000 in 1991, although it fell to 540,000 in 2003 following a contraction of total government employment. The percentage of SC employees in total government employment increased from 12% in 1956 to about 16% in 2003, fairly close to their share in the population. The absolute number of ST employees increased from 38,0000 in 1960 to 211,000 in 2003, which represented an increase from 2% to 6% of total government employment.Further, there has in recent years been a clear improvement in human development indicators among SCs and STs. Between 1983/84 and 1999/2000, for example, monthly per capita consumption expenditure and literacy rates among SCs and STs both increased, while the incidence of poverty fell. Nevertheless, the size of the improvement has generally been lower among SCs and STs than among other groups, so that SCs and STs continue to lag behind other segments of the Indian population.The above evidence clearly shows that there has indeed been a rise in the living standards of the depressed communities, though only partial. Thus in this respect, the system of affirmative action seems to fulfil its purpose and hence alright prima facie.But on closer observation, we find several basic questions: is it alright to reserve some opportunities of the public domain for a specific community? Shouldn’t merit be valued over societal structure? Do the communities need to be reminded again and again about their exploitative history? Does this not undermine the unity of the country by creating a divide between the communities?The answer to the first question lies in the basic idea of affirmative actions itself. The upliftment of the communities in its entirety is based on the idea of economic independence of these communities from the higher castes. The idea of economic strata becomes important in this aspect, especially in the Indian context as it proves to be the difference in the treatment of Adivasis and the immigrant Parsis and Muslims in the medieval era. Thus in this context, it becomes essential to provide them with the jobs to become independent. The Indian society, laden with the caste system was reluctant to provide them with jobs and thus it became quintessential for the government to reserve a portion of its jobs for these communities, to uplift them.A similar argument goes for the concept of merit. The idea of merit itself is dependent on economic factors. Let’s go back to the two cases of Raghav and Ramesh. The fact that Raghav belongs to an upper caste family means that he can afford much more refined education than Ramesh, the latter, even if he is brilliant can’t afford to go to coachings and hence is not at par with Raghav in terms of training and education and hence is at a disadvantage. Thus it becomes necessary for entities like Ramesh to enjoy some relaxation in the marks criteria, to compensate for the lag.The answer to the third question lies in the fact that as humans we always try to cover up the facts that highlight our mistakes. This question represents a form of moral policing for the depressed classes, insisting that what happened was history and should be forgotten. The line of thought is similar to the fourth question as well. However, one must remember that instead of covering up our mistakes, we should accept them and then move forward, while trying to rectify them at the same time. These actions are, in essence, only a minor rectification of two millennia of exploitation. Lastly, a country only remains unified until the communities residing in it are happy and prosperous and feel their importance in the country. Thus, these actions also take care of such aspects.ConclusionThe ethicality of affirmative actions depends on a variety of factors, foremost amongst them being the contempt faced by the communities spanning millennia. There are questions but they dull in comparison to the mammoth task of social inclusion these actions serve. But, in spite of all that, one question still shines out like a star: What if these communities begin to misuse the system, using it to undermine the opportunities of others, even after becoming prosperous? This question has indeed been thought out well and hence a provision of a ten-year limit on implementation of the reservation system in India.A better solution, however, would be to implement economic status based reservation instead of caste-based. This would ensure that the advantage would reach only those people who need it. Further, it is also important to note that in the sprawling metros of today, people of both upper and lower castes face the impact of poverty alike. Thus, it would resolve this problem too. However, this can only be implemented when the discrimination based on caste is almost non-existent in the Indian backdrop, so that caste is no longer a barrier in the public sphere.

This document was, as per the manners of naming everything in NRTI, called the Graduation Thesis Project or GTP for short and carried two trimesters worth of credits. It was thus, with the same excitement that befalls a boy when he has a learned a new trick, that the whole batch of 2019-22 plunged into the creation of this esteemed work of academia, which shall, for the remainder of duration of their stay at NRTI would be a mark of their excellence. And accustomed as everyone is at this young ripe age, to the inherent mechanisms of herd behaviour, I followed along (though I still believe it was inevitable task that would have demanded my attention sooner or later) and found a mate of similar interests in Mr Anshuman Bajpai. And hence we set off on a journey long enough to let us know each other well but yet short enough that we almost overshot the time limit prescribed by the Institute. Out of this conundrum was born our final GTP, on the topic “2-Wheeler Electric Vehicles Purchase Intention: A Study of Indian College Students”. I do not intend to bore my readers further and rather let them decide the quality of our work featured in the upcoming blog posts." }, { "title": "Graduation Thesis | Abstract", "url": "/blogs/posts/graduation-thesis-abstract/", "categories": "NRTI, Thesis", "tags": "nrti, thesis, electric vehicles, comparative study, EVs, abstract", "date": "2022-07-22 23:51:00 +0530", "snippet": "The crescent global concern about climate change caused by automotive greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the environmental destruction of natural resources, is pushing world economies to adopt a innovative alternative fuel technology. Electric vehicles are being posed as a green and sustainable innovative technology which has the potential to empower a streamlined transition to a low-carbon transportation system while preserving natural resources. Numerous nations have put forth extraordinary attempts to help the utilisation of electric vehicles as of late; for instance, Modern nations together with Norway and the Netherlands in Europe and the United States have strengthened individuals’ desire to utilise electric vehicles through suitable appropriations and concealment of private vehicles. In Asia, Taiwan has been fostering the arrangement of supplanting fossil fuel based traditional two-wheeler vehicles with two-wheeler electric vehicles (TWEVs) and reinforcing the approach through supplanting countless old TWEVs and sponsoring the acquisition of TWEVs. This study was conducted on college going students, as they were the main likely category to purchase TWEVs, and their idea of natural manageability can be moulded for developing vehicle use propensities. This study uses a survey form to investigate the factors influencing the purchase of traditional two-wheeler and factors that will prompt a college going student to purchase a two-wheeler electric vehicle in near future. Factor analysis is conducted on the Likert scale data obtained through questionnaire survey to club the lots of variables into a few factors for easier interpretation. This study used IBM SPSS software to carry out factor analysis. Later on, A comparative assessment has been done of the factors affecting purchase intention of fossil fuel based traditional two-wheeler and two-wheeler electric vehicles." } ]
